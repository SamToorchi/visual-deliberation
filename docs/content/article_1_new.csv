1;ChepCon;3;2;1;1;2015-11-20 00:32;The Basic Law IS our constitution. The Art. 146 GG, which you referred to, regulates the procedure in which this constitution, called the Basic Law, could be superseded by another.;

1;MisterMankind;6;5;5;5;2015-11-20 00:35;This claim is evidenced by the entire legal literature wrong.

1;ChepCon;8;3;2;2;2015-11-20 00:37;With the completion of the state unity of Germany on 3 October 1990 the basic law became by the sovereign and conscious decision of the German population to the all- German constitution.  The majority (it seems) is for the death penalty.However, the death penalty contradicts our constitution and our attachment to human rights. There are many such examples.Protecting the people from themselves also means protecting parts of the people from other parts. Sometimes worried citizens are demanding laws that would be massively discriminated against if decided. This is not recognized.And yes, one must rightly be afraid of the people's decision, that should also have the people. Therefore, we have representative democracy, but not the peoplebut in the context of the conditions this people guaranteed all the greatest freedom, which would be in danger (freedom) if everything would happen on referendums.;

1;Rotomon;23;4;11;11;2015-11-20 00:52;Well, if you followed your arguments, probably a monarchy would be the best form of government. Since the people can not decide anything (is protected from themselves), can initiate any changes in the law and can then trigger any contradictions.At the same time, a lot of money is saved for the various parliaments and much worse than under Queen Merkel, it probably would not run. In addition, an average king would probably be better educated (given his life-long preparation for his job) and would have as many officials at his side as the government.But that's just not a real democracy, even what we do not have. In addition, Switzerland would be an unfree, impotent Moloch your argumentation. what some ofArguments already refuted.And let us take your example: If the overwhelming majority were for the death penalty and it were democratically determined, then it would have to be introduced. Because that's the people's will. If individual persons could then decide not to do this - for whatever reason - then it is not a national rule. Then we would be back at the cost and e ff ectivity point at the beginning of my contribution.But that's just my opinion and unfortunately it does not count that much in our system (see above).;

Thousands of people have already arrived via Italy or GR. De jure not necessarily our construction site, but in fact our problem.

There were also good reasons against it.No matter, was decided by the ministers of the 16 countries with different governments and the competent Minister of the Federal Government.Merkel did not have anything to do with it.Why also P?

The question might look like this:How many places should the refugee contingent of the Federal Republic of Germany for the year 2016 offer you? 0 10,000 50,000 100000 500000 1000000 5000000 Other Number [Register] Unlimited There would then be a good legitimisation basis for a policy on which no one has yet voted in the federal elections in 2013 and which nevertheless could have very far-reaching, irreversible consequences for the country and the individual life chances of many citizens.;

The established parties roared once again from the right, just so that the SPD has taken over this requirement in their party program below.So, when we talk about democracy, we should also live it de fi nitively  according to our constitution, all power emanates from the German people.However, in some of them this is already going to be right-wing extremist, then I seem to seek the right of self-determination of the peoples, which is attributed to all peoples, apparently not the German.As far as the NSA is concerned, Ms Merkel should have taken her hat as responsible.;

On the other hand, people from Africa and Asia who escaped from the large collective camps due to poor living conditions.Merkel has decided to reject the Balkan refugees, but not the others.This decision is highly explosive. Explain to an economic refugee from the Western Balkans why the economic refugee from Africa or Asia is preferred.You understand what I mean? Merkel has partially suspended the case-by-case examination of the asylum law.On the subject of Greece: In the course of protracted negotiations, the Greek government repeatedly raised the issue of ""refugees"". That went from the cry for help to blackmail.Merkel has done nothing for it. Important was the bank resolution etc .. The refugee issue was not treated separately.Sta? ? of which she has enforced another aid package, of which one knew in advance that it will not be enough (without Schuldschni?.).Then to expect that Greece manages the refugee flow almost alone, bordered on purpose.Great, when people praise a politician who ""solves"" part of a huge problem (conditions at the railway station in Hungary there / refugee flow from the Middle East there), a huge problem that she has co-responsibility.Great as rabies.";

Not a good idea.Otherwise, I think Merkel benefits from her commitment to the Balkans. Partially more noticed by the foreign press than by the Germans. But is a complex field with many interests and problems.GR. That, too, was less one-sided than what you said. GR has already received funding from Brussels months ago. The onslaught began in May, starting in June it was serious and in July Junker waved the money. The problem with GR is that they can blast the land with money and nothing is going on.

Arrangement for the provision of certain areas for housing, establishment of a fund decoupled from the Greek State budget to finance the camps, etc.Clear!

Also, every reasonably thinking person should be concerned about how narrowly merged idealism and politics, or romanticism and politics of these days in Germany are (again). The resulting problems are not yet assessable. What is certain, however, is that following high ideals often requires a certain emotional state - and who wants to enforce that with every single German citizen (quite apart from asylum seekers)?

Merkel opines that it is just as exposed to the forces of nature as Germany, including Schröder, in 2002 at the height of the century.For me, a physicist creeps covertly into a mystic (which historically has happened to some physicists) and the ""ethics of responsibility"" applaud this as an achievement. I really thought we had overcome the times of morality instead of the rule of law, and obviously let myself be fooled.Obviously, Merkel is considered the absolute and unequivocal standard for civilization and morality. I'm curious how their fans will react to this, if in a few months the total reversal of direction of Merkel is initiated. The newly discovered tool of Moralkeule against need for discussion will then again serve well - arbitrariness at its best.";

All the debates about asylum law, any constitutional amendment or overriding the right of asylum have started to break up, and have been nothing but stun grunts and lies that have been served on the people in order to cover up the fact that immigrants are not entitled to any legal rights but a political decision to have these people here.It was from the beginning to let these people against the Constitution and contrary to all national and international laws and contracts in the country, so that they can make an asylum application here, resulting in a long-term asylum procedure, although it was already established from the beginning that none of the Applications would ever be granted, because there is no right of asylum.This is probably the reason why it takes strangely enough time to work on it, because until today it is not one hundred percent clear what ultimately will come out as a status at the end of this process at all.;

And to make an application, everyone is entitled to. According to the Geneva Convention, even an ""illegal"" border crossing does not change that. The overall protection rate (Recognition according to §19a, GFK, subsidiary protection and ban on deportation) was more than 50% in October.If you allude to the political decision of the summer of this year - you forget what the situation in the refugee camps in Hungary and elsewhere has been. It was perfectly right to take in these refugees and spare them a month-long odyssey from border to border. That was also completely within the law, see the self- immigration of a state to Dublin III.That's what it was all about from the beginning: finding a solution in the sense of humanity. Still, this is made possible by the countless volunteers. The mumbling and bad-mouthing from the right corner, on the other hand, is just disgusting.

The local discussion was already includedThey appear to be of the opinion that the use of jurisdiction leads to the legalsystem itself being undermined and the right of asylum to be carried out purely on the basis of moral considerations.It may be unnecessary to further comments on this.Seeing Mr. Stegner / SPD in the discussion round at Maischberger, whereupon the blessed Stegner commented on the hint of the Slovak on our German constitution only that it would be simply not interested in the reasons of morality everything.

It may therefore be doubted, really it is based solely on moral reasons, or else it is an ideological-political decision.And it may be doubted whether the welcome culture would have been so frivolous if the population had been given pure wine right from the beginning in order to distinguish it from constitutional reasons or a political decision that was simply intended ,;

This is a general principle that we already recognize from Roman law.This legal principle is relatively easy to admit: a fundamental right, which is addressed as a defense against the state or as a right to benefits directed to the state, you can lubricate yourself in the fresh-lashed legal hair, if by granting exactly the state, the right is to grant, thereby perishing.Concretely related to the asylum law: this also does not apply without limit. Germany is only obliged to grant asylum rights quantitatively to the extent that the constitutional existence of the state is not impaired or violated. By the way, especially in the area of asylum law, the principle of the Federal Constitutional Court would still have to be observed that the state has the task of preserving its own identity.It is even arguable that this task is not already enshrined as a right to benefit in fundamental rights, which means that every single citizen can demand from the state that he or she must just maintain that identity.;

This number is very hard to imagine, spread over days is about 150 people per day. I witnessed the arrests in Paris on site, there were many friends in the open streets and I am shocked at how many people have lost family members or friends. However, it is inconceivable for me to experience terror of this magnitude for years every day, but this is exactly the case for all the Syrian refugees we are talking about here and also the reason that they are going through such an arduous journey (in August already 2,000 dead in boat accidents h ps: //www.tagesschau.de ...) to finally get to safety. In addition, they are followed by the terror of Europe. And do not worry, those of the Syrians who identify with the ISIS stay there and fight there, especially Muslim refugees are a bad sign and his self-explanatory Goester state.;

This social rejection is only useful for ISIS to recruit Europeans, which was clearly stated in their video (""we urge all Muslims in Europe to join ISIS"").
